# camtimers

The camtimers library is a timing library specifically for use in the [XGC](https://hbps.pppl.gov/computing/xgc-1) gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code. It is based on an older version of the [GPTL](https://github.com/jmrosinski/GPTL) library.

At this time, this library is not designed for general public use. If you are looking for a general purpose profiling library. you may want to consider [GPTL](https://github.com/jmrosinski/GPTL) instead.
