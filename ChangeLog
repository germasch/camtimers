timing_191022: Bug fixes: reordered parameters in two memset calls,
               moved use of thread id to after it is defined, and
               renamed threadid formal parameter to tid, since a
               global named threadid already exists.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180912: Moved prefix support from perf_mod.F90 to gptl.c
               and also added support for setting prefixes in
               threaded regions.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180911: Moved detail to end of timer name when specify
               profile_add_detail (so that will not interfere with
               planned move of the prefix logic into gptl.c)
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180910: Removed addition of double quotes to timer names in
               perf_mod.F90 and added this as an output option in 
               gptl.c (so internally the names do not have the quotes)
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180822: Fix perf_mod.F90 bug that prevents PAPI derived events 
               from being recognized.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180805: Update pre/post/checkpoint performance archiving
               scripts to use phy122 project space by default
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180731: Refactored implementation of append/write modes; tweaked
               "running processes" logic and output format
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_180730: Merge changes from 20180403 version of E3SM timing
               library: add GPTLstartstop_val(f) and t_startstop_valsf;
               replace all strncpy calls in f_wrapper.c, just to be safe;
               add probable bug fix to update_stats routine; adopt
               differences in support for BGP and BGQ in GPTLget_memusage.c
               and GPTLprint_memusage.c; add CPP define changes to 
               eliminate warnings for redundant definitions. Also fixed 
               errors in f_wrappers.c in definition of gptlpr_query_append 
               and gptlpr_XXX_write.
               [Patrick Worley, much based on work by Jim Rosinski]
timing_171210: Free work space to fix memory leak.
               Work space in the function merge_thread_data
               in gptl.c was not being freed at the end of the
               routine. This was found by a memory leak analysis
               and not from diagnosing a model run issue. (This
               routine is not called often and the work space
               involved is relatively small.)
               [Michael Deakin (implemented here by Patrick Worley)]
timing_171025: Mitigate against nonmonotonic timing calls.
               The earlier commit setting negative deltas to zero
               did not have the intended effect. Moved this logic
               before updating the accumulated wallclock time.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_171012: Refactor of pre/post/checkpoint performance archiving
               scripts. Output from system routines at ALCF, NERSC,
               and OLCF had changed, necessitating corresponding
               changes to these scripts. Also decreased the amount
               of data being archived.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_170801: Improved support for Cori-KNL.
               This included setting negative deltas to zero
               (not specific to, but motivated by, Cori-KNL)
               and opening namelist files as FORMATTED.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_170731: Added support for accelerators with addition of
               t_accel_startf and t_aceel_stopf commands.
               [Patrick Worley and Stephen Abbott]
timing_161208: Cleaned up white space, to match what done in CIME.
               Also introduced t_profile_onf and t_barrierf/detail
               logic fix from CIME.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_161207: Replaced strncpy and snprintf where applied to
               non-null-terminated strings, to avoid memory issues
               when strncpy and snprintf implementations use strnlen
               to check validity of passed in string length parameter.
               (Why this causes problems is still a mystery.)
               [Patrick Worley and Gautam Bisht]
timing_160816: Added quotes to timing event names in t_startf and t_stopf
               before calling GPTL routines.
               [Patrick Worley and Sean Patrick Santos]
timing_160416: Added routines t_set_prefixf and t_unset_prefixf.
               Setting the prefix adds this to the beginning of all subsequent
               timer event names (defined in t_startf/t_stopf).
               Also doubling default hash index tablesize to 2048.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_160222: Imported timing_140805 to timing_160124 from the latest ACME version
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_160124: Added option to prefix timer names with detail level. This is
               controlled by a new namelist variable (profile_add_detail).
               The default is to not enable this option. It is meant to be
               used for inspecting the profile detail definitions and
               associated logic.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_150903: Changed API to be compatible with NCAR CIME version of timing
               library: (a) changed handle argument from integer8 to integer
               in t_startf and t_stopf, and disabled use of handles in these
               routines until gptl.c can be updated; (b) added MaxThreads
               optional argument to t_initf, though it does not do anything
               yet.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_150518: Disabled abort when calling GPTL routines before GPTLinitialize
               (so can use with Chombo library, for example); changed top
               level default from nanotimer to MPI_WTIME.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_150327: Added option to more accurately measure measurement overhead
               (incurring additional overhead, so not on by default).
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_150217: Added support for enabling/disabling start/stop timers from
               perf_mod even when calling GPTL routines directly from C/C++
               libraries; increased maximum timer name length.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_141119: Enabled cmake build of timing library.
               [Jayesh Krishna]
timing_140805: Disabled GPTL autoinstrumentation, as this conflicts with the
               VampirTrace tool. (We do not use the autoinstrumentation
               capability.) [Patrick Worley, from B. Jamroz]
timing_140526: Added explicit specification of access to be sequential in file open commands
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_140417: Added BGQ support for the memusage commands, imported from latest
	       CESM version
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_130806: Minor modifications to sync with latest CESM version, including
	       changed declarations of functions used in qsort in gptl.c, to eliminate
	       error with Cray compiler (and warnings from other compilers);
	       also added routines supporting non-null terminated timer labels, for use with
               with C++ std:string (and more efficient usage with Fortran)
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_120930: Minor modifications to sync with latest CESM version and to add
               show_descendants when GPTL finds a logical bug in descendants calculation
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_120803: Replaced SPMD token with HAVE_MPI in Makefiles (to fix bug introduced
	       in sync with CESM version); fixed timing_detail_limit initialization bug.
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_120802: Bug fix in global statistics logic for when a thread has no events
	       to contribute to the merge (mods to gptl.c)
               Replace process subset optional parameter in t_prf with
	       outpe_thispe optional parameter. Change def_perf_outpe_num to 0.
	       [Patrick Worley]
               Minor changes for mpi-serial compile. Make HAVE_COMM_F2C default to true.
	       (Also other minor, probably CESM-specific, updates.)
	       (jedwards)
timing_120110: Update to GPTL 4.1 source (mods to gptl.c and GPTLprint_memusage)
               [Jim Rosinski (GPTL 4.1), Patrick Worley]

	       improved support for MacOS and SLASHPROC
	       [Jim Rosinski, Chuck Bardeen (integrated by P. Worley)]
timing_091021: update to GPTL version 3.5; rewrite of GPTLpr_summary: much faster, merging
	       events from all processes and all threads (not just process 0/thread 0);
	       miscellaneous fixes
	       [Jim Rosinski (gptl 3.5), Joseph Singh, Patrick Worley]
timing_090521: Added optional parameter global_stats to t_prf to enable/disable output
	       of global statistics. If present, this overrides the default set with
               namelist variable profile_global_stats.
	       [Patrick Worley]
timing_081025: updated to gptl version 3_4_2. Improved support for large process counts
	       and for writing timing files to subdirectories
               [Jim Rosinski, Patrick Worley]
timing_080920: added optional parameters perf_outpe_num and perf_outpe_stride to t_prf.
	       These are used to override the user specified values for timing data
	       written out before the end of a simulation.
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_071208: modified print logic to support output of timing data during a run
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_071201: changed default to disable inline keyword; changed global statistics
	       logic to avoid problems at scale; moved shr and CAM routine equivalencies
	       to a new module (in perf_utils.F90); added t_getLogUnit/t_setLogUnit
	       routines to control Log output in same way as shr_file_get/setLogUnit
               [Patrick Worley]
timing_071023: updated to gptl version 2.16, added support for output of global
               statistics; removed dependencies on shr and CAM routines; renamed
               gptlutil.c to GPTLutil.c
               [Patrick Worley, Jim Rosinski]

	       changed default number of reporting processes to 1;
               reversed meaning and changed names of CPP tokens to NO_C99_INLINE and NO_VPRINTF
               [Patrick Worley]

	       CPP token C99 is defined.
               [Patrick Worley]

	         PAPI counters
               - added papi_inparm namelist and papi_ctr1,2,3,4 namelist
	         parameters to specify PAPI counters
               [Patrick Worley, Jim Rosinski]
timing_070525: bug fix in gptl.c
               - unitialized pointer, testing for null pter
                 before traversing
               [Patrick Worley]

	       - defines all t_xxx entry points - calling gptlxxx directly
	         and removing all external gptlxxx dependencies,
                 added detail option as an alternative way to disable
	         event timing, added runtime selection of timing_disable,

	         output into a single file to perf_mod.F90
	       modified gptl.h
	       - exposed gptlxxx entry points and to add support for choice
